# Advanced-Restaurant-Sentiment-Exploration


This project analyzes customer reviews for over 8,000 restaurants in Hyderabad, offering insights to enhance business strategies. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, it evaluates feedback across key criteria, including Taste of Food, Service Quality, Ambience, Cleanliness, and Value for Money.

The data was gathered through web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, enabling the automation of review collection from over 500 restaurants simultaneously. Once collected, extensive preprocessing was applied, including cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, ensuring high-quality data for analysis. Missing values and outliers were carefully handled to maintain dataset integrity.

Machine learning models such as Random Forest and Decision Trees were used for sentiment classification. The models achieved a commendable accuracy of 95.4%, with strong precision and recall scores, making them reliable for analyzing customer sentiments. The classification process revealed valuable insights into customer satisfaction trends, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement in restaurant services.

Visualization played a crucial role in the project. Dashboards were created to present trends in customer sentiments, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret the results. Key insights included identifying patterns in customer preferences and addressing recurring complaints, helping restaurant owners implement targeted improvements.

This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency in data scraping, NLP, and machine learning but also emphasizes the practical application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. By providing actionable insights, it enables restaurants to make data-driven decisions, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

Overall, the Advanced Restaurant Sentiment Exploration project showcases expertise in end-to-end data analysis workflows, from data collection to actionable insights, proving its value in the highly competitive restaurant industry.
